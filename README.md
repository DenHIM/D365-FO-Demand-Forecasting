# Project <!-- KFM: I think we should have a better title. I suggest the actual name of this project. -->

This repository contains template scripts that you can use to set up your Azure environment to generate demand forecasts using the Azure Machine Learning Service, which you can then integrate with the demand forecasting feature of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. For details, see [Demand forecasting overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/master-planning/introduction-demand-forecasting).

## Set up your Azure subscription to generate demand forecasts

To enable your Azure subscription to generate demand forecasts, we recommend that you use `setup.ps1` <!-- KFM: Use how? Run? (Run where?) Where does this file come from? (This repository?) for example: "... run the `setup.ps1` script included in this repository on your Azure environment ..."  --> and follow the instructions provided by the script. Alternatively, you could set it up manually as described in [Document name](#) <!-- KFM: Link needed. -->

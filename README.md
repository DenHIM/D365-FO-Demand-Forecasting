# Templates for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management demand forecasting with Azure Machine Learning

This repository contains template scripts that you can use to set up your Azure environment to generate demand forecasts using the Azure Machine Learning Service, which you can then integrate with the demand forecasting feature of Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. For details, see [Demand forecasting overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/supply-chain/master-planning/introduction-demand-forecasting).

## Set up your Azure subscription to generate demand forecasts

To enable your Azure subscription to generate demand forecasts, we recommend that you run the `setup.ps1` script included in this repository on your Azure environment and follow the instructions provided by the script. Alternatively, you could set it up manually as described in [Demand forecasting setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165514).
